          # Replace the deployment steps below with your specific deployment logic.
          # For example, you can use SCP to copy the zip file to a server.
          # Or, if deploying to an external service like AWS S3, you can use AWS CLI.

          # Example: Deploying via SCP to a server
          # - scp abc.zip user@server:/path/to/deployment/directory/

          # Example: Deploying to AWS S3 (assuming AWS CLI is configured)
          # - aws s3 cp abc.zip s3://your-s3-bucket/
